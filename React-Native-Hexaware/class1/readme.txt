This is the fundamental component of React Native for building a user interface
It is a container that support layout with flexbox, style, touch handling and accessibility control
it maps directly to the native view similar to whatever platform on React Native app is running on
it display components regardless with 
UIView - ios
<div> - web
android.view  - android

view component can be nested and can contain from 0 to many childrens of any type


> State and props
there are two type of data state and props in React Native which control the component
the component that uses the state is mutable
they can be changed later as oer requirement

the props component is immutable and it is fixed throughtout the lifetime
